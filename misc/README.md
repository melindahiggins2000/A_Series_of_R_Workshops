# and test some citations

Here is a citation for `knitr` [@xie2015knitr] which didn't work like usual citations. so let's try `citet` Temple Lang and team (2015) or also with `citep` (Temple Lang and team, 2015).

Try one more (Rehdanz and Maddison, 2005) and (Wickham and Chang, 2015).

Try one of mine (Fitzpatrick, Higgins, Holguin, et al., 2010) 

also try (Fitzpatrick, Higgins, Holguin, et al., 2010)
