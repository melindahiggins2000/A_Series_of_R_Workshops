rigor and reproducibility

nature articles

amgen experiments 2012 - 53 preclinical studies

F1000 webpage - outlet for reproducibility - publish verification studies
AMGEN going to start publishing their work here

support for OPEN SCIENCE

journals unite for reproducibility - nature and science partnered on this

making dat aavailable - the DRYAD experience - data repositories
DOIs for datasets (Gary Miller and Lance Waller working on)

to be addressed in the research strategy of a grant proposal
* scientifics premise - evaluate strengths and weaknessed of earlier research (lit search/refs) - building on a strong or weak foundation
* scientific rigor - strict scientific methods - torubst, unbiased expt design, methods, analyses, interpretation and reporting - include transparency of all analyses
* Strict application of scientific method - 1993 book Apprentice to Genius - some followinh hunches, taking flyers, tinkering is OK - but much be evaluated rigorously before publishing and finalizing
* 
* cell lines - biological and chemical resources - cell lines, strains, commerical products - test your reagents and commerical antibodies - don't trust what comes from the manufacturer

These should be addressed within the proposal - reference where in the proposal each is addressed. Janet Gross focus on grant writing aspects

these will be WITHIN the overall impact consideration

NIH NOT-OD-15-103 -- see end on implementation -- on due dates 1/25/2016 and beyond

* scientific premise in research strategy and in significance and in approach
* could all attachment under the other research plan sections
* SEE in GRANT application guide - SIGNIFICANCE in (3) Research Strategy - in PURPLE on PDF from WEB - new stuff from last
* 

USE these new words in the frant - higlight them in approach and human subjects - bold them - use in headers or underline

SEE NIH reproducibility FAQs - great ways to get good language!!

identify and MANAGE high risk studies - regarding rigor

history and integrity of data repository - quality control - selection, storage, transport (samples)
but also - history of existing datasets or repositories - background - validity - data checks - use rigor, trandparency language to support using this dataset...

barely statistically significant is this really biologically relevant - define why p-.05 is appropriate because...

not needed for K's and NRSAs yet... coming in the future

CAREFULLY your FOA closely regarding these issues

new NIH grant form pages (Form D) are coming at the end of March 2016
