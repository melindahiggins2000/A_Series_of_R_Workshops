# How to Install R

### Download the software

1. Getting the Software
    + Go to the CRAN homepage at https://cran.r-project.org/ 
2. Download and Installing R 
    + Look in the box at the TOP of the CRAN homepage
    + For [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/) - click on the link for "BASE" and then download the current version of R. I would suggest installing the 64-bit version as appropriate for your operating system.
    + for [Mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) - read through the specifics to see which package (PKG) is best for your operating system version.
    + NOTE: If you are interested in further development using R, like building your own packages, you may also be interested in downloading and installing Rtools (windows) or tools (Mac).

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```r
> summary(cars)
```

```
     speed           dist       
 Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
 Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
 Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
 Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](figure/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png) 

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
