### How to Install R

1. Getting the Software  more at https://cran.r-project.org/ 
2. downloading and installing R [first box on CRAN homepage]
    + for Windows  https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/  click on the link for "BASE" and then 
download the current version of R. I would suggest installing the 64-bit version as appropriate 
for your operating system.

package (PKG) is best for your operating system version.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```r
> summary(cars)
```

```
     speed           dist       
 Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
 Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
 Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
 Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2](figure/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png) 

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
