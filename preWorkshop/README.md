# Pre Workshop Set-up Instructions

Before you begin these workshops, there are a few things you need to do first. Mainly installing the R software and the RStudio IDE (integrated development environment). The following sections will go through the steps and weblinks for installing R and RStudio. These steps will cover getting your computer set-up and ready for the Spring 2016 R Workshops.
