This "book" is the assembly of the materials compiled for the "Series of R Workshops" held Spring 2016 at Emory University - School of Nursing. These workshops were led by Melinda Higgins, Ph.D., associate research professor and senior biostatistician.

The Series for Spring 2016 is currently planned to have 4 workshops - each 2 hours long with a focus on hands-on learning using R and RStudio. These workshops will be introductory and provide the skills necessary to begin to be comfortable working with R and RStudio performing data analysis and writing research reports.
